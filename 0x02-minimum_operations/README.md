# Minimum Operations Project

## Description
This project provides a solution to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to generate exactly `n` characters `H` in a text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Files
- `0-minoperations.py`: Contains the implementation of the `minOperations` function.
- `0-main.py`: Main file for testing the `minOperations` function.

## Function Prototype
```python
def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of operations required to get exactly n H characters in the file.
    :param n: int
    :return: int
    """
